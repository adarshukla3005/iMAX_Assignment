## Installation and Setup  

Follow these steps to set up and run the Hinglish Cold Calling AI:  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hinglish-cold-calling-ai.git
cd hinglish-cold-calling-ai
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install FFmpeg (Required for Pydub) and Add it to your environment variables.
- Pydub requires FFmpeg to process audio files.

🔗 Download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) from here.

### 4. Configure API Keys

Create a .env file in the project directory and add your API keys:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
EMAIL_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password  # Use an App Password, not your main password.
```

### 5. Set Up Google Calendar API
If you want to enable demo scheduling:

Go to Google Cloud Console
Enable the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?pli=1&project=llm-langchain-449320)
Download credentials.json and place it in the project folder as calendar_credentials.json.

### 6. Run the Streamlit Frontend
In a new terminal window:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the web UI in your browser and start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
