            "question": "Given that the candidate's previous responses are empty (an empty array), the next question should be a broad, introductory question designed to gauge their overall understanding of the field and their experience.  I would ask:\n\n\"Can you tell me about a data science project you're particularly proud of?  Walk me through the problem, your approach, the results, and what you learned from the experience.\"\n\nThis question accomplishes several things:\n\n* **Open-ended:** It allows the candidate to showcase their skills and experience in a way that feels natural to them.\n* **Comprehensive:** It covers several key aspects of the data science lifecycle (problem definition, data acquisition and cleaning, modeling, evaluation, and conclusions).\n* **Revealing:**  Their answer will reveal their technical skills, communication abilities, and problem-solving approach.\n* **Basis for follow-up:**  Their response will provide ample opportunities for follow-up questions that delve deeper into specific aspects of their project.\n\n\nThis is a much better starting point than jumping into highly technical questions before establishing a baseline understanding of the candidate's capabilities and experience.",
            "answer": "I have create a Pizza sales analysis project based on EDA analysis of Data from the company and then I create Powerbi dashboards and analyse various parameters in many ways."

            "question": "Given the candidate's response about a pizza sales analysis project using EDA and Power BI,  a good next question would be:\n\n\"That's interesting. Can you tell me more about a specific EDA technique you used in your pizza sales analysis and the insights you gained from it?  For example, what did you discover through correlation analysis, or what interesting patterns did you find using visualizations?\"\n\nThis question probes deeper than just a surface-level description. It requires the candidate to:\n\n* **Demonstrate specific knowledge:** They need to recall and explain a particular EDA method.\n* **Show analytical skills:** They need to articulate the insights derived from the analysis, not just the methods used.\n* **Highlight problem-solving:**  The question implicitly asks them to explain how they used the data to answer a business question.\n* **Go beyond Power BI:** While Power BI is mentioned, this question focuses on the core data analysis skills.\n\nThis follow-up question is better than simply asking about the Power BI dashboard because it gets to the heart of their data analysis capabilities, which is the primary skill for a data scientist.",
